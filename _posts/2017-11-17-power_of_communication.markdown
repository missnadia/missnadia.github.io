communication is one of the most important components of human interaction. we use it daily to communicate our needs, address concerns, and express social cues. on the other hand, it is also one of the most complicated. [the same sentence can be interpreted differently depending on the style and instrument used](https://youtu.be/naleynXS7yo). for example, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" contrasts starkly with "what are you doing?", although the meaning or the content of the message is identical, the delivery of the message (how that message is conveyed) affects whether or not the intended outcome is produced.

initially, when learning how to code, it can get tempting to ignore aesthetic factors such as putting in extra indentation spaces or cleaning up blocks of code for better user readability; however, choosing to do so opens up the possibility of creating bad habits that become hard to correct in the long run. similarly in personal relationships, if you get lazy with establishing good communication, you will open yourself up to the possibility of frequent misunderstandings and your message may or may not be clear to the intended audience. if we put in the extra effort to try to communicate in a way that allows the other person to understand us better, everyone benefits.

not only does communication apply to the way we write code, but also to the way we collaborate with others in producing a final product and in the ability of using client/user feedback to fix bugs, improve upon an existing product, or inspire a new idea. thus, it is important for us to always be mindful in the way we write our code so that it can be understood not only to us, but to others involved.

what use would a language be if you were the only person to understand it?
