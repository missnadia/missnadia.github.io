no need to fear, technology is here.

the first renaissance was the cultural bridge between the old world and the new modern world, moving from a society centered around religion to a more cultured society focusing on art, literature, architecture, politics, and science. it gave birth to the "renaissance man," added to the canon of art history, but most importantly accepted the theories and discoveries of science, contributing to the development of the scientific method. it was a dramatic change from a society that sought religion and God to answer the questions of humanity and its place in the world.

prior to the first renaissance, the church labeled science as the teachings of the devil, labeling those who opposed the church as heretics and punished them accordingly. the church was the highest power, after God, no questions asked. the church was the law. yet, ironically, the church was riddled with corruption from within and abused their power of influence by selling indulgences to their faithful followers as a requirement for entry into the kingdom of heaven, subsequently leading to the reformation and the modern age.

in the past 20 years, the advancement of technology has changed modern society in unrecognizable ways. for example, i remember having to memorize phone numbers or having to write them down in an address book so i can call my family or friends on my house phone or with a pay phone. i had to submit homework in paper form and in person. all of my hardcover books had to be covered with a book cover and if all of my teachers decided to give homework that same day, i had to walk home with a giant turtle shell on my back. if i wanted to pay my bills, i had to mail a check via regular mail. even when there was consumer access to the internet, i had to wait for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UY7eDRXrs) and no one could use the housephone once i was online. when i entered college, email, online document submissions, and facebook were very new integrations to collegiate life and were considered optional or supplementary.

the aforementioned examples perhaps illustrate the start of the second renaissance and at present day still climbing on an upward slope at an accelerated pace. like the first renaissance, the second renaissance is flagged by the shift in the relationship from what we have been used to (technology-aided society) to a society integrated with intellectual inventions (technology-integrated society). unlike a technology-aided society, a technology-integrated society threatens the viability of certain jobs and industries that are unable to adapt and integrate technological change, causing unrest in those directly involved. however, technology will continue to advance and we will have to learn to adapt. otherwise, how would evolution have been possible if we never learned to adapt to our environment?
