what are their differences?

in JavaScript, you can declare variables by using one of the following keywords:

* 1. var
* 2. let
* 3. const

1. var
* function scoped - only available inside the created function. if not defined in function, the scope is global

2. let
* value can be re-assigned
* block scoped

3. const
* the value of const cannot be re-assigned because it creates a read-only reference to a value
* block scoped
