declaring variables in JavaScript

in JavaScript, you can declare variables by using one of the following keywords:

* 1. `var`
* 2. `let`
* 3. `const`

1. `var`
* function scoped - only available inside the created function. if not defined in function, the scope is global

2. `let`
* value can be re-assigned
* block scoped

3. `const`
* the value of const cannot be re-assigned because it creates a read-only reference to a value
* block scoped
