finished my final portfolio project.

i can't believe that i am finished! it's been a long journey trying to balance a full-time job with studying, but somehow i did it. in retrospect, i enjoyed the portfolio projects the most because it allowed freedom and creativity, but it was the most challenging because i couldn't finish them in one sitting.
