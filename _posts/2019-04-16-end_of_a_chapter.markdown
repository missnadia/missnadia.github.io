finished my final portfolio project.

i can't believe that i am finished! it's been a long journey trying to balance a full-time job with studying, but somehow i did it. in retrospect, i enjoyed the portfolio projects the most because it allowed freedom and creativity, but it was the most challenging because i couldn't finish them in one sitting.

with this React Redux project, i was suprised that i remembered how to setup the Rails routes. usually when i go back to a previous lesson i find myself relying on Google a lot, but i guess my GradStat Rails/JS project really burned routes into my long-term memory. what helped me a lot was watching a lot of videos via Learn Instruct, which helped reinforce the lessons. it helped me to get more familiar with React/Redux terminology and gain exposure to the various ways of writing the same code. with each project, i found myself relying more and more on planning out my projects either by drawing them out or writing them down. pre-planning helped me to organize my thoughts and draw out any concepts i had in mind. i found it easier in some cases to add CSS styles to certain components to help visualize which areas i needed to organize better.

i think React-Redux was interesting to work with and plan on creating additional projects in the future.
