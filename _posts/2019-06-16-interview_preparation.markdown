preparing for my first pair programming interview.

i will be having my first Ruby on Rails pair programming interview this week and i'm excited for the experience! i've been preparing for it by reviewing any related portfolio projects as well as reviewing the fundamentals using previous lessons. i have also been reading some of the top Google hits for "[Ruby Interview Questions](https://www.upwork.com/i/interview-questions/ruby/)" as well as reading the [documentation](https://rubyonrails.org/). in the next two days before my interview, i'm going to try to create a new application for muscle memory purposes, and hope that this will be enough for me to proceed to the next round. <br>
one of the biggest challenges throughout my job search has been the balance between my current unrelated full-time job and the actual job searching/interview process. hopefully this interview goes well so that this wouldn't be an issue anymore!
