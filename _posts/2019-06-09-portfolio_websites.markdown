project after graduation.

after graduating from the Flatiron School, i've been trying to gather some insight from alumni on what they did after graduation. one of the things that they mentioned was having a portfolio website. something that wasn't on my radar until after graduation! <br><br>

as i was researching for inspiration, two of the most inspiring resources are:

1. [Robby Leonardi](http://www.rleonardi.com/)
2. [instagram of webpage design](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/)

as for website templates:

there's a little bit of pressure that goes into portfolio websites because they're supposed to showcase not only your work, but also who you are as a person. it's a great way to let your personality shine through amongst the PDFed resumes HR receives on a daily basis. currently, i'm drafting the textual content of my portfolio website. i've decided to use React due to its modular components and possibly import my blog as an API. i haven't decided yet if i'm going to use routing to make each page its own or if i'm going to make it into a single page application. i know i want to make it responsive, but i don't have to worry about that until i start playing with the CSS. will keep updating as i make some progress!
